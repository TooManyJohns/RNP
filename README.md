# RNP

This is a ReactNative training project for myself that will be worked on throughout the Summer of 2020.
It's purpose is to re-create the Pokedex Application from HeartGold/Soulsilver as a fun exercise to get me aquainted with the framework.

~~Versions (note for myself)~~
"react": "16.11.0",
"react-native": "0.62.2",
"react-navigation": "git://github.com/Snailapp/react-navigation.git#2.18.5"

# To run the app:
The Current Project Scope is focused on iOS as I'm on limited time to do this project. If time permits I will try and branch out to other platforms on 10ft and android devices.


$ yarn install

Start the bundling Server in ../RNProject:

$ yarn start

$ react-native run-ios
