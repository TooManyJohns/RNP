# RNP

This is a ReactNative training project for myself that will be worked on throughout the Summer of 2020.
It's purpose is to re-create the Pokedex Application from HeartGold/Soulsilver as a fun exercise to get me aquainted with the framework.

It's using ReactNative version 2.18, and will be primarily tested on iOS Mobile Devices (I will be testing on my iPhone, possibly other emulators in the future through XCode) 

# To run the app:
The Current Project Scope is focused on iOS as I'm on limited time to do this project. If time permits I will try and branch out to other platforms on 10ft and android devices.
